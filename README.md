## Description
A simple and unsecured banking application that includes account creation, a working login, deposit and 
withdrawl pages with field validation and a data summary page. It utilises a standalone Single Page Application 
Routing framework as well as styling with Bootstrap and React functionality.

## Run Instructions
Copy all files in this folder to a new directory, then drag and drop the index.html file onto a browser. 
This app is also deployed on amazon web services with an S3 bucket 
at "https://dan-phillipsbankingapplication.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html".

## Future Development
Further detailing of the input field validation to cover corner cases and make the validation a bit more robust.
I would like to refactor into a create-react-app for the learning and ideally add linking of the user data to an e
xternal API database to allow for persistent info.
